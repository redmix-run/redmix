- feat(deps): Upgrade to Clerk Core v2 and Clerk React v5 (#99) by @Tobbe

This PR updates redwood's usage of Clerk authentication to [Clerk Core 2](https://clerk.com/docs/upgrade-guides/core-2/overview) which was introduced back in April 2024 as the new major version for Clerk.

Notable breaking changes:

- The `frontendApi` prop is no longer supported on `<ClerkProvider>`
- The `process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL` and `process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API` env vars are no longer used (Only `process.env.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is used)
- The `process.env.CLERK_API_KEY` env var is no longer used on the api side.

See https://clerk.com/docs/upgrade-guides/core-2/overview for more details
